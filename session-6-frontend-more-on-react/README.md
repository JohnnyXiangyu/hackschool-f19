## Component state

## Inputs

## Callbacks 

## A simple app using state, input, and callbacks

We are going to make a play generator where we will be able to see a script that we generate ourselves. 
To do this we will select the character we are creating dialogue for, and then input the dialogue that we want. 

Go ahead and copy the following boilerplate code. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    
    <!-- Don't use this in production: -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">
    
      class App extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            <>
            </>
          );
        }
      }
      ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
    </script>
    <!--
      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.
      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project
      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:

</html>
```


### Showing dialogue

Last week we saw we can have a list of strings and then use a for loop to create a list of Tweet components. This was
happening inside of the render function. But what if we wanted our elements to update on the screen whenever a new element was added?
We can do this with **state**. With state, we can store certain properties that belong to the component. When the state object changes,
the component's render function is called. 

We can initialize state in the component's constructor. Remember that the constructor happens when the component is first created.
```
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                playLines: [],
                selectedCharacter: null
            };
        } 
```

To understand super(); you need to learn about object orientated programming. Feel free to look it up. We initialize playLines 
to an empty list because our play is empty right now. Also, we don't have a selected character to create lines yet. We are
keeping this in the state because we want the visuals to update every time a new play line is added and we want to make sure
we update the character who is speaking that line. 

```
        render() {
          return (
            <div className="play-container">
             {this.state.playLines.map(line => <DialogueLine key={line} content={line} />)}
            </div>
          );
        }
```

We can use map here in order to take all of the lines we have in this.state.playLines to create DialogueLines. We create a 
DialogueLine component here because we are going to create our own unique grouping of HTML elements and reuse them. 

So, lets add a DialogueLine component to our project.

```
      class DialogueLine extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            <div className="dialogue-container">
                <div className="dialogue-words">
                    <p>{this.props.content}</p>
                    <br />
                </div> 
            </div>    
          );
        }
      }
```

Here are the styles for the 3 classes we just saw. 

```
.play-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}

.dialogue-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100vw;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

.dialogue-words {
    height: 100%;
    width: 80%;
    background-color: lightgray;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
```


We can test this out by adding some strings to our playList property in the constructor. 

### Adding dialogue

Next, we can create an input so that we can spontaneously add lines to our play. Let's create an input component to do this. 

First, lets add this input component to our App and decide what to do with the input we will get.
We want to be able to add lines to our play visual and in order to do this,
we can pass a callback to DialogueInput. 

```
        render() {
          return (
            <div className="play-container">
             {this.state.playLines.map(line => <DialogueLine key={line} content={line} />)}
             <DialogueInput addLineToPlay={this.addLineToPlay}/>
            </div>
          );
        }
      }
```

So, when a user inputs text and presses submit, we will add the line to our
script by passing that text back up to App so that we can update this.state.playLines. 

```
      class App extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                playLines: [],
                selectedCharacter: null
            };

            this.addLineToPlay = (e) => { this.addLineToPlay(e); };
        } 

        addLineToPlay(e) {
            this.setState(prevState => ({
                playLines: [...prevState.playLines, e]
            }));
        }

        render() {
          return (
            <div className="play-container">
             {this.state.playLines.map(line => <DialogueLine key={line} character={line.character} content={line.content} />)}
             <DialogueInput addLineToPlay={this.addLineToPlay}/>
            </div>
          );
        }
      }
```

bind(this); creates a new function that sets its this to the current value. Consequently, the current instance of the component 
is the value referred to by this. 

We can see we are passing in the function addLineToPlay to the props of DialogueInput. This function is a callback.  Callbacks
are a function that are run at a later time. 
This means that the parent component gave the child component this function to be used later.

The function will allow the child to pass information back up to the parent, so that it may do what it wishes with it.
In this case, we are going to pass up the inputted text back up to the play generator from the input component. 

We can see we add the line to the array of lines in the state object. Take note of the syntax. We use setState and do not
access this.state directly. Also, because we are using an array, we have to use the spread syntax in order to create a new 
array with the new text and store it into state. 

Here is the DialogueInput component.

```
      class DialogueInput extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            <form>
                <label>
                     Enter a beautiful line:
                    <input type="text" name="content" />
                </label>
                <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
            </form>
          );
        }
      }
```

This gives us a basic form but we aren't doing anything with it right now. In React, the component handles what to do with any 
interaction with the above input. So, we want to have the component keep track of what has been inputted and what to do if the
user hits submit. 

Change the existing DialogueInput to look like the following. 

```
      class DialogueInput extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {value: ''};

            this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
            this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        }

        handleChange(event) {
            this.setState({value: event.target.value});
        }

        handleSubmit(event) {
            this.props.addLineToPlay(this.state.value);
            event.preventDefault(); 
        }
            
        render() {
          return (
            <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
                <label>
                     Enter a beautiful line:
                    <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
                </label>
                <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
            </form>
          );
        }
      }
```

Let's digest a few of the lines we see.

Here event.preventDefault() just prevents the page from refreshing. 


We can see they are passed into the onChange and onSubmit events as event handlers. Event handlers are a type of callback.
So, when the component is rendered, the functions are not called yet. They are kind
of stored away for later use if those two events happen. 

We can see in handleSubmit, we are using the callback function we previously saw in App. 

So effectively, as we interact with the input, handleChange is called with whatever was typed in. This is then stored 
in the component's state object. Later, if we hit submit, then handleSubmit is called and we pass the text back up to App.


### Adding characters

So we generated lines but usually a play and script has multiple characters. Let's go ahead and add the ability to choose
a specific character that we want to 'speak' the lines. 

Let's add some characters and choose them as the 'current' speaker by using buttons. 

```
    setCharacter(e) {
        this.setState({
            selectedCharacter: e.target.id
        });
    }

    render() {
      const characters = ["Chimmy", "Shooky", "Koya"]
      return (
        <div className="play-container">
         {this.state.playLines.map(line => <DialogueLine key={line} content={line} />)}
         {characters.map(name => 
         <button id={name} onClick={(e) => this.setCharacter(e)} className={name == this.state.selectedCharacter ? "selected" : "unselected"}>
          {name}
         </button>)}
         <DialogueInput addLineToPlay={this.addLineToPlay}/>
        </div>
      );
    }
```

Here we created buttons for all of the characters we want in this play. When the button is clicked, we will set the state object's 
selectedCharacter to the character name. We can see for the style of the button, we have a ternary statement happening.
Basically, if the most recent clicked on character button id  matches the button id that is about about to be created,
we want to make it seem selected. So we give it a selected style while all the other buttons get an unselected style.

Here's the styles.

```
.selected {
    color: black;
    background-color: lightgreen;
}

.unselected {
    color: black;
}

```


Now that we can have a selectedCharacter, let's add the name to each DialogueLine. We can do this by checking who
the selectedCharacter is as we add the line to the script. We change an object in the array to be a dictionary instead of just
the line string so that we can have an object to have character and content properties tied together. 

```
  addLineToPlay(e) {
      const fullLine = {
          character: this.state.selectedCharacter,
          content: e
      }
      this.setState(prevState => ({
          playLines: [...prevState.playLines, fullLine]
      }));
  }
```

We can now pass this character information to DialogueLine. 

```
{this.state.playLines.map(line => <DialogueLine key={line} character={line.character} content={line.content} />)}

```

Let's update our DialogueLine to show the character name. Also, let's go ahead and add an image to our DialogueLine.
We can create a dictionary of images and then choose the correct image link in the dictionary by matching the character name. 

```

  render() {
    const allImages = {
        "Chimmy": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0231/6137/2752/products/1200_chimmy_8809573079480-1_2000x.jpg?v=1565212917",
        "Koya": "https://www.bt21.com/im/character/bt21/koya.gif",
        "Shooky": "https://cdn130.picsart.com/293144906007211.png?r1024x1024"
    }
    return (
      <div className="dialogue-container">
          <img className="dialogue-image" src={allImages[this.props.character]}/>
          <div className="dialogue-words">
              <h3>{this.props.character}</h3>
              <p>{this.props.content}</p>
              <br />
          </div> 
      </div>    
    );
  }

```

Here's the style. 

```
.dialogue-image {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}

```


Now, we have a fully functioning script/play generator where we can make up stories with whatever characters we want!
