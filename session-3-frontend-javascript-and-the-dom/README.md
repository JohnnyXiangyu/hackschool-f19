## Goal of today

- Understand how you can use JavaScript to change the DOM

## The DOM

So, "DOM" stands for "Document Object Model" and this is basically a **concept**
(read: not anything concrete, not a specific file, not a certain browser, not
anything like that) that thinks about HTML documents and web pages as a
hierarchy of parent components and child components. Generally, the most
parent-level "component" would be the `<html>` tag, containing two children: a
`<head>` and a `<body>`. Also generally, the `body` component will contain many,
many children.

Something that tripped me up wrapping my head around the DOM was: _"Ok, well_
_what's the alternative then? How is the "DOM" different from the actual HTML_
_page? They look absolutely identical."_

Well, in most cases, they will! But let's take an example (absolutely beautiful)
web page:

![Dog webpage](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9cfjehIDb6_rYkUgq8bf_-skpsxf8WexJ0E0fwfsL7jyjYExLX6-2CYtx-cEyfJpUCLPx0u3LPLBOf1bmpnbFlgOVG6o3mjIDNlS3A7Uow_5JwqBnhLvjYdm0PCB2l8aCcUea79Y)

This is what the browser returns to us, as the user. It parses a certain HTML
file and generates this output. This is **not** the DOM! This is the web page!

Ok, so then let's take a look at that HTML file!

![HTML](images/html.png)

As you can see, we have a `head` and a `body` and within that body we have a
heading `h1`, an image `img`, and a paragraph `p`. This is a pretty simple web page and the structure of the HTML file is not at all complicated. But this is still **not** the DOM! What's the difference?

Well, let's say that I made a mistake in my HTML file. Whoops! I accidentally
forgot to close my `<p>` tag, oh no! Now my HTML file isn't valid anymore!
But... when I go into Google Chrome, everything's fine! What gives?

This is where the differences between the HTML (the "source code" if you will)
and the DOM start to become apparent. The DOM is the representation the browser,
and ultimately, the user, have of a certain web page. And so, if the browser is
smart and/or kind enough, it will say "Oh, hey, you left out the closing p tag
here, but when I'm making the DOM, I'm pretty sure I knew what you meant so my
DOM is still just gonna have a regular paragraph, cool? üëå" And we say "Yes,
very cool thanks!!" (Don't do this in public, for some reason people are
uncomfortable if you talk to your computer ü§∑‚Äç)

The difference in the HTML file and the DOM become absolutely **huge** when you
start getting into JavaScript that renders HTML for you like React or Vue (this
is for another workshop though, one thing at a time!). The HTML file is often
incredibly simple, containing only a single `<div>` named "app" and some meta
information in the `<head>` whereas the DOM will be a fully-functional web app
with headers and sidebars and images of dogs everywhere!

That brings us to \*drum roll\* **the DOM!!!**, at last the elusive creature.

## Accessing Elements

First let's review JavaScript objects:
Objects in JavaScript are collection of data. Each piece of data has a "key" and a "value".

Let's make an object called `person` and they go to school at UCLA.

Here is the syntax.

```JS
let person = {
  age: 18, // notice the comma
  school: 'UCLA'
};
```

Here the `age` is the key, while `18` is the value. Each pair is also known as a **property** of the `person` object.

To get the value of a property, we can put a dot between the object variable and the property key: `person.age` will give us 18, while `person.school` will give us `'UCLA'`.

Objects can hold different types of data.

We can even add more data to it‚Ä¶

```JS
person.birthday = '17 Aug, 1948';
person['name'] = 'Gene Block'; // alternative syntax, notice the quote
```

‚Ä¶ or change existing properties ‚Ä¶

```JS
person.age = 71;
```

We can put functions into objects as properties as well.

```JS
person.shout = () => {
  console.log("AAAAHHHHHHHHH!");
};
```

We can tell Gene Block to shout by calling the `shout` function like this.

```JS
person.shout()
// AAAAHHHHHHHHH!
```

`document` is an object that contains all the elements of the page. It is provided by the browser and comes with many helpful functions that help us access elements.

Let's try them out on the [CS 31 Course Syllabus](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs31/syllabus.html)!

Recall that in the browser console, if we type a variable name and hit enter, the value of the variable will be printed out.

```js
// This returns an object that contains all the elements of the page
document;

// This is returns a link element with the id 'objectives'
document.getElementById("objectives");

// This returns an HTML collection of tr (table row) elements
document.getElementsByTagName("tr");

// Select elements the same way as CSS selectors
document.querySelector("#website");
```

Autocomplete gives us some more:

## Manipulating the DOM

Now that we know how to find elements in the DOM using JavaScript, let's manipulate them mwahaha...

```js
// Assign the element with the id "website" to the variable w
const w = document.getElementById("website");

// Add some HTML to the element
w.innerHTML = "bread ";
```

Notice that we use the same object syntax to set the `innerHTML` of an HTML element as we do to set the `age` or a `person` object.

We can also set the style of an element. Anything you can set using CSS, you can also set with JS. Note that JS uses camel case instead of dashes. So the CSS style `font-style` would become `fontStyle` in JS.

```js
w.style.color = "red";
```

For a collection of elements (not just a single element), use a `for` loop to process each element one by one.

```js
const trCollection = document.querySelectorAll("tr");
for (let tr of trCollection) {
  tr.innerHTML = "<h1>let's get this bread</h1>";
}
```

Lastly, we can also add new elements to the DOM.

```js
const divElement = document.createElement("div");
divElement.innerHTML = "<h1>let's obtain this grain</h1>";
w.appendChild(divElement);
```

Wow! So in theory we could actually have just one element in our HTML source and run a bunch of JS that adds more stuff. This is why on most modern websites, if you check out the HTML source code, it's far less than the actual DOM.

## Practice

Find all the `h3` tags on the CS31 Syllabus and replace it with your preferred meme. Then change the `fontStyle` to `italic`.

## Event Listeners

One way JavaScript can make web pages more interactive is with event listeners. An event listener is a function that waits for a particular event to happen, such as a click, a mouseover, a keydown, or many [more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). Elements on the page know when they're being clicked, and we can provide instructions to the element for what to do when clicked using JavaScript. Run this in the browser as an example:

```js
w.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
});
```

If you click the `w` element, you should see "Clicked!" in the console. What if we want to know the element that was clicked? When the function you've provided runs, it actually comes with an `Event` object that has a lot of useful information. Here, I've named this object `e` and by using `e.target`, I can access the element that was clicked. With this element, I can do any of the changes we've learned previously--for example, changing the style.

```js
w.addEventListener("click", e => {
  console.log(e.target);
  e.target.style.color = "blue";
});
```

There are [many properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) associated with events besides `target`. If you're not sure how to do something, look it up!

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Bread Gallery ‚≠êÔ∏è

To get started with this project, go to the `demo` folder and copy/paste `index.html` to your own `index.html`. Feel free to change any of the images to your preferred images. Then create an empty `style.css` file and an empty `script.js` file in the same directory.

If this feels unfamiliar to you, check out [Hackschool Session #1](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-1-intro-to-frontend) to learn about HTML/CSS.

Notice that the line `<script src="script.js"></script>` is added at the bottom so that our JavaScript file will run on the page.

One common pattern seen in image galleries is lowering the opacity of unclicked items. Your mission is to use JavaScript to make this image gallery more interactive.
![Bread Gallery](images/breadgallery.png)
If one of the images is clicked, change the opacity of all the images to 0.5. You will also need to change the opacity of the clicked image back to 1.

For extra practice that requires some research on your own: when you click a selected image, all images turn back to full opacity. Hint: use [classList](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/195951/how-to-change-an-elements-class-with-javascript).
