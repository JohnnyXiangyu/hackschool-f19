## An Overview of This Session

This session will be different then usual. We won't be teaching from the start of the session. This session is about doing! By the end everyone will have made their own page that

## What we'll be learning today

- Review of...
  - HTML (Front end)
  - Styling (Front end)
  - How to serve a page (Back End)
  - React (Front end)
  - How to serve data (Back End)
- Then we're going to make `fetch()` happen
  - That's so `fetch()`!

## HTML

The basis for a lot of web development is HTML. Before we do anything, we need a page.

### Objective

Try creating a static html page. It doesn't need to be fancy. Make it about something you care about! I did mine on Magic: The Gathering<sup>TM</sup> cards. Try to put something on your page that can be repeated later (for me, it was Magic cards).

### Tips

- `<div>` tags seem kind of weird, but they're great for clumping a group of elements together (in my case, it was a card's name and image inside a `div`)

## CSS

The one who wins is the one with the most _style_. Styling is essential for any webpage.

### Objective

Add some style to your page. I suggest you call your stylesheet style.css Mine looked like this:

<img src="assets/html_page_styled.png"/>

### Tips

- Here's a link to our [CSS workshop](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-4-css-layout)
- If you have a collection of things, `flexbox` is really nice.
  - Remember! You make the _container_ of all of your stuff (MTG cards in my example) into flexbox! Not each card.

## Order Up! Serve Your Page!

<img src="assets/front_vs_back.png"/>
What we have been doing so far is all front end. We used HTML to build the structure of our page and CSS to define the style. Now we want to create a back end to serve our page and, eventually, store information.

### Objective

Create an endpoint `GET '/'` that serves the page you created

### Tips

- [Our intro to backend session](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-2-intro-to-backend)
- Some setup for you
  - Create a file index.js in the folder with your html file
  - Open your command line and go to that folder
  - Type `npm init -y` and press enter
    - the `-y` option makes it so you don't have to press enter for all of npm's questions
  - Type `npm install express` and press enter
- Remember to start your your server with `app.listen`!
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to exit!

### A Speed Bump: Where Did the Styling Go?

If you've gotten this far, you may realize that your styles don't show up! This is because your server never sent them. No one ever told it to. We can fix that.

First, we need to have a way for our front end to ask the server for the stylesheet. Sounds like a job for an endpoint! Create a `GET '/style.css'` endpoint that responds by serving your stylesheet (style.css). This is very similar to the previous endpoint

Change the `link` tag in your html file so that your have:

```
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "http://localhost:3000/style.css">
```

This makes your HTML page ask the server for the stylesheet instead of looking for it in your computer's files.

## React

If we want to define new types of 'elements' – which we'll call components – to reuse them, React is very handy. In this section, we want to use React to create a reusable component for part of your page.

### Objective

Create a react component that takes in at least one prop and use that component at least twice on your page. In my example, my component had the name of my card and a picture of it.

Also make an `<App/>` component to display your entire page. In the `constructor` for `App`, set the state equal to a list of objects representing the data for your smaller react components (you should be able to pass this data in for your props). For now, hard code all of your objects. My `App` constructor looked like this:

```javascript
constructor(){
    super();
    this.state = {cards: [
        {
            name:"Kykar, Wind's Fury",
            url: "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=466966&type=card"
        },
        {
            name:"Niv-Mizzet, Parun",
            url: "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=452942&type=card"
        }
    ]}
}
```

### Tips

- [Our React workshop](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-5-frontend-intro-to-react)
- [More on React: App Constructor Example](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-6-frontend-more-on-react#showing-dialogue)
- Our React component shouldn't need too many bells and whistles. We can just use a `class` that `extends React.Component`. You'll want a `render()` function that `return`s the jsx (which is like html with some javascript) that makes up your 'element'.
- `render()` can only return one element, so you can wrap your html like so: `<>YOUR_HTML</>` or like so `<div>YOUR_HTML</div>`

## Serving Data

What makes webpages very cool is the ability to get data from the backend. There are to parts to getting data from the server. The server must provide a way (endpoint) to request the data, and the client must ask for it (`fetch`).

### Objective

Let's do half of the job. Try creating an endpoint that returns an array of objects that you create on your backend. For now, it will return the same list every time. You can create it globally (outside of any methods at the top of your file). The objects should be relevant to your page! Here's an example that I used.

```js
const cards = [
  {
    name: "Kykar, Wind's Fury",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=466966&type=card"
  },
  {
    name: "Niv-Mizzet, Parun",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=452942&type=card"
  }
];
```

### Tips

- Use `res.json(*your array/json*)`
- Remember `app.use(express.json());` at the top of your code

## Connecting the Frontend and the Backend

So far, the frontend and the backend have been independent. We use Postman to test that the requests to our backend work. And we hard code some data on the frontend. What we actually want is for our frontend to make requests to the backend. There are several ways to make requests using JavaScript, but today we'll be going over `fetch`! Looks familiar? Our backend workshop on async used the `node-fetch` library which is based on this `fetch` in the browser.

### Using fetch to get data

```js
const response = await fetch("/cards");
```

`fetch` is a built-in function in JavaScript that we can use to make requests. This is how `fetch` looks like when you make a GET request. Here we are making a request to the URL "/cards". By default, if you don't put "http://..." you make a request to the same URL that the page was served from. Since we're doing this locally, "/cards" will mean the same thing as "http://localhost:3000/cards". Remember that this is how a URL looks like when we're making a request in Postman as well.

`fetch` returns a promise, since it takes some time to get data back after the request is made. If we use the keyword `await` before a promise, we will make sure that the data has come in before we give the `response` variable a value. If we omit `await`, then our response will just have the value of a pending promise. For more, check out [our previous workshop on Async/Await](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f19/tree/master/session-5-backend-async).

In order to get the actual JSON data from the response, we need to use the `.json()` function.

```js
const response = await fetch("/cards");
const responseCards = await response.json();
```

`responseCards` will now contain JSON data that looks something like this:

```js
[
  {
    name: "Kykar, Wind's Fury",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=466966&type=card"
  },
  {
    name: "Niv-Mizzet, Parun",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=452942&type=card"
  }
];
```

### When to get data in a React Component

It takes some time to get data and there is no way to pause rendering during that time, so we want to have some default state while the data is still on its way or if the data never arrives due to failure. One way we can do this is by setting some default state in the constructor. Previously we had hard coded cards, but now we're in a world where the frontend doesn't know what cards will be served by the backend. So let's just use an empty array:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { cards: [] };
  }
  // more stuff below this
}
```

The first time after the component is rendered with our default state, we want to make our request. This is done with the built-in React Component method `componentDidMount`.

This [article](https://daveceddia.com/where-fetch-data-componentwillmount-vs-componentdidmount/) explains why we use `componentDidMount` in more detail.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { cards: [] };
  }

  // async is needed because we use await inside
  async componentDidMount() {
    const response = await fetch("/cards");
    const responseCards = await response.json();
    this.setState({ cards: responseCards });
  }

  // ... render() below
}
```

## Making a POST request with fetch

First let's make an endpoint that allows us to change what cards are on the server. In `index.js`, add:

```js
app.post("/card", (req, res) => {
  cards.push(req.body);
});
```

In our example, we have an array called `cards` in `index.js` where we store an array that looks like this:

```js
const cards = [
  {
    name: "Kykar, Wind's Fury",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=466966&type=card"
  },
  {
    name: "Niv-Mizzet, Parun",
    url:
      "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=452942&type=card"
  }
];
```

We assume that `req.body` (the request body) will be an object with the structure

```js
{
  name: "Niv-Mizzet, Parun",
  url:
    "https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=452942&type=card"
}
```

So what the code above does is adds this new card object to our array of card objects.

Now let's add a form on the frontend so the user can input a card.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { cards: [], name: "", url: "" };
  }

  // componentDidMount here

  updateName = e => {
    this.setState({
      name: e.target.value
    });
  };

  updateUrl = e => {
    this.setState({
      url: e.target.value
    });
  };

  render() {
    const cards = this.state.cards;
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Tim's Favorite Magic Cards</h1>
        <div>
          <div>
            Card name:
            <input onChange={this.updateName} value={this.state.name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            Image URL:
            <input onChange={this.updateUrl} value={this.state.url} />
          </div>
          <button>Save!</button>
        </div>
        {/* .. more stuff below*/}
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

Now we should have two input fields that the user can type in.
The last thing is to make a POST request when the user clicks the save button.

```js
// Add this function to the App component
newCard = async () => {
  const { name, url } = this.state;

  // JSON.stringify turns a JavaScript object into a string
  fetch("/card", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: new Headers({
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }),
    body: JSON.stringify({ name, url })
  });

  // Reset the input fields
  this.setState({ name: "", url: "" });

  // Get the cards again
  const response = await fetch("/cards");
  const responseCards = await response.json();
  this.setState({ cards: responseCards });
};
```

```js
// Update the button onClick handler
<button onClick={this.newCard}>Save!</button>
```
